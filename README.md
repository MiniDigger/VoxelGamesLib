###### Multi-platform, fully-featured, data-driven, abstract and expendable minecraft minigames framework

> WIP! This project is nowhere near finished. while the foundations are pretty much done, nothing is working right now!

This will be a large-scaled, fully modular minigames api for many minecraft server platforms. the plan is currently to support both bukkit (including spigot and paper) and sponge. Other may follow (PE anyone?!)  

Take a look at the website: http://voxelgameslib.minidigger.me/  
It hosts useful information about the project and the documentation.

> The website isn't done yet. Nothing on it is done yet. Its just a tech demo for the tech behind it!
